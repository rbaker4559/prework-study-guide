Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

## Description

My motivation for bootcamp is to continue advancing my career in SaaS; from sales to leadership. Built this project as a refresher on things I've self-educated and to prove commitment to the path I've chosen (prove to myself). Problem that this assignment solves is to establish a light foundation ahead of getting deeper into syntax specifics.

## Installation

## Usage

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
